As noted on the Google.org blog post titled &#8220;[Getting Data From the Ground To the Cloud](http://blog.google.org/2011/06/getting-data-from-ground-to-cloud.html)&#8220;, Google recently hosted the first gathering of the Community Forest Monitoring Working Group. The goals of the working group are to provide a platform for groups engaged in community forest monitoring activities to share knowledge and experience. 

Many in the working group use ODK for data collection, and so the core team was present to answer questions ranging from form design to device choice. We also demoed some of the upcoming functionality in ODK.
