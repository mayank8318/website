Peter Fleming from [Bankable Frontier Associates](http://www.bankablefrontier.com/) is using ODK to conduct surveys that support their clients in their efforts to expand financial services to the poor.

He writes, _&#8220;We&#8217;re using 16 Huawei Android IDEOS ($90 each from Safaricom, they come unlocked). I was a bit worried about using such cheap phones, but they have been perfect so far (2 weeks), and have collected more than 10,000 short surveys/census with GPS, without a single glitch. </p> 

In Airplane Mode, the batteries last for 2 full days of data collection. You could compare these IDEOS to the HTC Magic, just a bit smaller and cheaper. I would highly recommend them if someone is looking for a cheap unlocked Android without a QWERTY keyboard.

Thanks for your tireless work on ODK &#8212; it&#8217;s improving our data quality and is changing our lives!&#8221;</em>
