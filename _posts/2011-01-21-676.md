The Surui people in The Amazon are using [Google Earth Engine](https://www.google.org/earthengine/) and other Google technologies to protect their forest and find a sustainable future for their territory.

You&#8217;ll see in the video below that they are using ODK Collect on the phones, but they are also using ODK Aggregate on the backend.
