For the last two years, University of Columbia&#8217;s [modi research group](http://modi.mech.columbia.edu) have been working to help a group of children in Kolkata, India use ODK Collect and [formhub](https://formhub.org) to map social issues in their community. These incredible children, known locally as the &#8220;Dare Devils&#8221;, were the subject of a documentary called the [Revolutionary Optimists](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/revolutionary-optimists) that recently aired on PBS. 

Inspired by the documentary, youth groups from around the world are starting to use ODK to map issues in their communities too! This global effort is called [Map Your World](http://mapyourworld.org) and you can watch the inspirational video about the project below.
