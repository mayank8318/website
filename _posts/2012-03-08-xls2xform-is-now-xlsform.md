Not just the name has changed, we now share a updated syntax with [Formhub](https://formhub.org/).

There is some backwards compatibility with the old syntax but we encourage you to transition to using the new syntax documented [here](//opendatakit.org/help/form-design/xlsform/).

Additionally, we made some improvements to our error messages, but hopefully you never find out what they are.

If you find run into any problems, please post them to our[ issue tracker](https://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/issues/list), or bring them up on our [community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/opendatakit).

And finally, here&#8217;s a link to XLSForm: <a href="//opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/" target="_blank">use/<wbr>xlsform/</wbr></a>
