[Group Complete](http://www.groupcomplete.com) by [Radical Dynamic](http://www.radicaldynamic.com/) was an awesome ODK-compatible data collection and aggregation platform for Android devices. It was known for features like seamlessly syncing forms across devices, pre-populating forms with data from Excel files, and flexible user permissions on groups of forms. You could even design forms on one device and push them to other users&#8217; devices! Unfortunately, due to a change in Radical&#8217;s direction, the service was shut down in February 2012. 

Today, Matt Adams, one of the Radical&#8217;s founders, has graciously open-sourced the Android client for Group Complete. The [code repository](http://github.com/radicaldynamic/gcmobile) is fantastic place to start if you are looking to build group-oriented and ODK-compatible data collection.

Matt is a fantastic member of the ODK community and we are deeply appreciative of this contribution. Again, the repo is at <http://github.com/radicaldynamic/gcmobile>. If you intend on releasing derivative works, please pay close attention to the [README](https://github.com/radicaldynamic/gcmobile/blob/master/README).
