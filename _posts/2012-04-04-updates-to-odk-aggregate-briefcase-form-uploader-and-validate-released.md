We&#8217;ve shipped a bunch of new updates to ODK tools this week. If you are using old versions, make sure to upgrade by going [here](/downloads/)!

[ODK Aggregate 1.0.6](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/AggregateReleaseNotes) now supports publishing of forms from Build. We&#8217;ve also added support do bulk delete submissions.

[ODK Briefcase 1.0.2](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/ODKBriefcase) and [ODK Form Uploader 1.0.2](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/ODKFormUploader) now work much better when accessing Aggregate through slow internet connections.

[ODK Validate 1.6](/use/validate/) fixes an issue where the same form would return different errors.

Again, you can find all the new versions [here](/downloads/).
