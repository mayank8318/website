Fresh on the heels of the [ODK Collect 1.1.7](/2011/12/odk-collect-1-1-7-released/) release, comes the ODK Aggregate 1.0.2 release!

If you are running the .9x versions of Aggregate and have not upgraded, you are missing out on a simplified installer, a new user interface, submission filtering, better data security, help videos, and a ton more features. 

If you are running Aggregate 1.0.x, this upgrade will fix a few bugs and make changes to help keep your App Engine quotas down.

Check out the demo server at [https://opendatakit.appspot.com](https://opendatakit.appspot.com/) to try things out, read over the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/AggregateReleaseNotes) and then [download](/downloads/) the update. 

As always, if you have any other problems upgrading or installing this release, please file a detailed [bug report](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/issues/list).
