[XLSForm](https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/) (formerly XLS2Xform) is a tool to simplify the creation of forms. Forms can be designed with Excel and XLSForm will convert them to XForms that can be used with ODK tools.

If the tool below doesn't appear or doesn't work, try some of the [other XLSForm converters](https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/).
