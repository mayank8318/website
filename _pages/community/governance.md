## Governance Overview

The Open Data Kit (ODK) project is governed by multiple governing committees. There are two categories of governing bodies, the Project Management Committee (PMC) and the Technical Steering Committees (TSC). The PMC is the ultimate authority over the project. The TSC is the authority over the technical direction of the project’s suite.

_Note: As ODK transitions out of the University of Washington, the current PMC’s authority will be transferred to a Transition Board. Once the transition is finished, the authority will transfer to a more permanent governance body (likely another PMC). The TSC will remain active throughout the transition process and post-transition._

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for high-level technical direction of their  suite. The TSC has authority over all technical aspects including:

* Suite roadmap (feature addition/removal, tool addition/removal, incorporating community feedback, etc.).
* Forming appropriate Working Groups (e.g., User Feedback, Documentation, Translation) to gather the necessary community feedback before making decisions.
* Technical resources (e.g., code repositories, servers)
* Maintaining the list of Committers

Wherever possible, the TSCs should choose shared policies and infrastructure which allow for consistent process, but administrative separation across suites. In the case where the TSCs cannot reach consensus on policies and infrastructure, the final decision will be made by a majority vote by the PMC.

Although the TSC may update the TSC governance (e.g. this document) as it finds appropriate, revisions are subject to PMC review and veto, as ultimate authority over governing the ODK project rests with the PMC. Any update to the TSC governing document must be approved by the majority of the PMC. It is expected that the TSC will have a collaborative relationship (perhaps some overlap in membership) with the PMC.
